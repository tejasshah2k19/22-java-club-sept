1) extends Thread
2) implements Runnable



two level of lock

1) instance - instance variable 
2) class  - static variable 

how ? 
synchronized 

when?
shared / common resource 
	instance variable - instance level lock - single instance - all thread  
	static variable - class level lock  - all instance - all thread 

1) method 
2) block 

------------------------------------------


t1 -> 1 to 10 
t2 -> 11 to 20
t3 -> 21 to 30 

t1 + t2 + t3 


------------------------------------------
t1 -> running -->
t2 -> runnable --> 


t1 sum 1 to 10  [ 1min ]
t2 sum 11 to 20 [ 1min ] 
t3 sum 21 to 30 [ 1min ]
total -> 1 min -> 3 thread are done

2
list out all!

sleep()
wait()
suspend()


which method(s) we can use to bring back thread from block to

resume() 

which method used to switching thread between running and runnable? 
yield()


which method kills the thread?
stop()
